1. Beta distribution

$p^{\alpha+1}q^{\beta+1}/B(\alpha, \beta)$

And you got some new data $X$

How should you update your prior?

Note the prior is

$P(p)$ is given above -- this is the prior.

Next -- important you have the likelihood!

$P(X|p)$ what is the probability of the data, given that the model has distribution $P(p)$

This is kind of strange because it is not really a probability, it is saying that if $p$ is distributed as the prior, then what is the calculated probability of seeing $X$.

Then the question is how do I modify the prior given $X$.

Use the posterior: $P(p|X)$ this can be obtained via Bayes' estimate: $P(X|p) P(p) / P(X)$

$P(X|p) = p^(success) q^(failures)$

so the posterior has the same form as beta distribution

And so the update is:

$\alpha' = \alpha + successes$

$\beta' = \beta + failures$

likehood measures how well the parameter explains the observed data
